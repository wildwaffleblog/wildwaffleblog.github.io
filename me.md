Hi! I'm Artöm, a solo creator from Russia working across comics, video, and game development. I love experimenting with storytelling and aesthetics, blending different media to create experiences that feel tangible and alive. My work often has a textured, "grainy" look inspired by film, adding depth and a sense of authenticity.

I approach every project with curiosity and attention to the process – for me, creation is as much about exploring ideas as it is about the final result. Whether I'm drawing comics with collaborators, crafting short films for my YouTube channel, or building interactive game prototypes, I enjoy uncovering the unique possibilities each medium offers.

Most of my content is in English because I want it to be accessible to a wider audience and to connect with people from different places and backgrounds.

When I'm not creating, I just like to do vibey things. I started this site and this blog to share those moments too.

And one more thing. I'm not a freelancer, and I'm not trying to make money from my work. I do all of this because it feels good. So just follow along and let's feel good together! You can find all the links below.
