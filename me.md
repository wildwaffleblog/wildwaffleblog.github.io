# About Me

Hi! I’m Artöm, a Russian creator exploring the worlds of comics, video, and game development. I like to experiment with storytelling and aesthetics, blending different media to create experiences that feel tangible and alive. My work often carries a textured, "grainy" look reminiscent of film, adding a sense of depth and authenticity.

I approach every project with curiosity and a focus on the process — for me, creation is as much about exploring ideas as it is about the final result. Whether it’s drawing comics with collaborators, crafting short films for my YouTube channel, or building interactive game prototypes, I enjoy discovering the unique possibilities each medium offers.

When I’m not creating, you’ll find me exploring small adventures or experimenting with visual storytelling techniques.
