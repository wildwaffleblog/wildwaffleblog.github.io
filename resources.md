# Resources

Here I collect tools, references, and materials that inspire me or support creative work. You’ll find everything from visual references, texture packs, and tutorials to insights into my creative process.

Some examples of what’s here:
- Free textures and grain overlays for visual projects
- Writing or storytelling prompts
- Tips for comic layout, video editing, or game prototyping
- Links to useful software, plugins, or learning resources
