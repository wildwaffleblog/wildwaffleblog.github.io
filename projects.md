Here you’ll find a curated selection of my creative work across comics, video, game development. I focus on the process of creation, exploring ideas and experimenting with visuals and storytelling. Each section highlights the essence of the medium and my approach to it.

## Comics

Comics are a core part of my creative journey, where narrative meets visual experimentation. I work primarly in collaboration with Alexey Platon, combining storytelling with detailed, textured visuals that give a tangible, "grainy" feel to every page. Each work is an exploration of atmosphere, character, and narrative rhythm, with an emphasis on the process and collaboration.

### Inktober 2025

In 2025 I finally managed to complete Inktober – something I’d been circling for years without ever quite sticking the landing. This time I did it the way it should be done: consistently, deliberately, and in a single visual language. Every illustration was created using stippling, a slow, obsessive technique built on countless tiny dots – the kind of process that forces you into patience, discipline, and sometimes a bit of madness. Out of that rhythm came a surprisingly cohesive story: a quiet horror narrative unfolding around a ruined prom night at a fictional British boarding school. It wasn’t planned as a storyline at first, but the pieces kept pulling toward each other until they formed a proper sequence – part diary, part myth, part crime scene reconstruction. I collected all thirty-one drawings, along with the final text, into a small book so the project could exist as something more than just a feed of posts. You can download and read the book right here.

### Klubnikin

“Klubnikin” is a short comic that takes you into the quiet rhythms of rural life in early 2000s Tambov district. Through the eyes of a child, it captures fleeting moments of curiosity, discovery, and the small but profound experiences that shape a childhood. The story is rooted in a real-life memory shared by writer Alexey Platon, whose perspective brings an authentic and intimate voice to the narrative. I had the privilege of translating this vision into illustrations, creating a visual world that reflects both the nostalgia and subtle melancholy of village life. The comic balances the everyday with the unexpected, offering glimpses into a past that feels both personal and universal. You can download and read the comic here in PDF or CBZ file format.

“PerDuck” is a weekly comic strip about an anthropomorphic, self-igniting duck. Whenever something irritates him, he spontaneously bursts into flames, turning everyday situations into chaotic and absurd spectacles. Set in provincial Russia in the years before the pandemic, the comic captures the quirks of small-town life, the frustrations of the mundane, and the humor hidden in ordinary moments. The series is a collaboration with writer Alexey Platon, whose sharp scripts bring wit and situational comedy to each strip, while I handle the illustrations, bringing PerDuck’s explosive personality to life. Each installment combines humor, social observation, and a touch of unpredictability, making the familiar world feel unexpectedly extraordinary.

## Filmmaking

My videos range from short films to experimental cinematic videos and vlogs, but they always focused on storytelling and visual texture. You can explore most of my work on my YouTube channel, where I share highlights of my experiments with framing, pacing, and mood. The video section is about capturing moments and ideas, experimenting with timing, lighting, and aesthetic grain, and sharing the creative journey.

<!-- ## Game Development

I build interactive experiences that explore mechanics and storytelling. My game project **Increment** focuses on [short description, e.g., minimalist strategy with narrative elements].  

The goal is to make players engage with subtle mechanics and visual texture, creating a tangible and immersive feel even in a simple digital environment. -->

<!-- ## Podcast

Podcasts are my space for exploring ideas, sharing thoughts, and connecting with listeners in a more conversational format. While this section is still developing, it will feature episodes that focus on creativity, storytelling, and insights from my projects.

Listeners can expect informal discussions, reflections on the creative process, and occasional guest appearances. The aim is to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, showing how ideas evolve and how projects take shape. -->
