Here you’ll find a curated selection of my creative work across comics, video, game development, and podcasts. I focus on the process of creation, exploring ideas and experimenting with visuals and storytelling. Each section highlights the essence of the medium and my approach to it.

## Comics

Comics are a core part of my creative journey, where narrative meets visual experimentation. I work collaboratively with Alexey Platon, combining storytelling with detailed, textured visuals that give a tangible, "grainy" feel to every page.

### PerDuck

### I shouldn't be here
[Brief description, e.g., an experimental comic blending psychological tension with visual texture]. Available [link].

Each comic is an exploration of atmosphere, character, and narrative rhythm, with an emphasis on the process and collaboration.

## Video

My videos range from short films to experimental clips, with a focus on storytelling and visual texture. You can explore most of my work on my YouTube channel, where I share highlights of my experiments with framing, pacing, and mood.

The video section is about capturing moments and ideas, experimenting with timing, lighting, and aesthetic grain, and sharing the creative journey.

## Game Development

I build interactive experiences that explore mechanics and storytelling. My game project **Increment** focuses on [short description, e.g., minimalist strategy with narrative elements].  

The goal is to make players engage with subtle mechanics and visual texture, creating a tangible and immersive feel even in a simple digital environment.

<!-- ## Podcast

Podcasts are my space for exploring ideas, sharing thoughts, and connecting with listeners in a more conversational format. While this section is still developing, it will feature episodes that focus on creativity, storytelling, and insights from my projects.

Listeners can expect informal discussions, reflections on the creative process, and occasional guest appearances. The aim is to provide a behind-the-scenes perspective, showing how ideas evolve and how projects take shape. -->
