VO:

I was walking home when I caught a strange scent.
Something sweet — but not food. Like smoke, or burnt leaves. Like the breath of something old.
I turned around — empty street. But my feet had already started moving on their own.

Past shut-down shops and fogged windows.
Through gardens long abandoned for the season — swings creaking, thin vines rustling where fences used to be.
The smell didn’t grow stronger, yet it stayed close, tugging me along.

I ended up outside the city. The air heavier now, colder.
The ground soft with fallen leaves, my steps swallowed by them.
Along the abandoned railways — rails half-buried in moss, iron glinting like wet bone.

There — in the middle of the tracks — he was waiting.

My childhood toy — Hedgehog-mitten.
A little dirty, but just the same. Soft fur, sewn eyes, that small stitched smile.
I used to sleep with him every night. He always smelled like home.

I picked him up — and the scent disappeared.
For a moment, everything went quiet. The air felt heavier.
Then I felt it — someone standing right behind me.
And just as I was about to turn around,
it breathed against my neck.
