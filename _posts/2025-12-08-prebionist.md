I consider the mockumentary genre one of the coolest. I’d actually love to shoot a lot more in that spirit. From a technical standpoint, this one was an interview, and honestly, editing interviews afterward is the most boring thing I’ve done in my videos. So if I ever make fake documentaries again, I’ll choose a different format.
