Boo! Did I scare you? I really love Halloween and everything around it. It’s just a shame that no one around me really celebrates it. Anyway, I wanted to convey a spooky, mystical atmosphere and at the same time share something personal. This is actually a toy from my childhood that was brought to me from IKEA. And I really did sleep with it throughout my entire childhood. And right noow it’s sitting on a shelf in my room, watching me write this post.
