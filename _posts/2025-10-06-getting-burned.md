title: "GETTING BURNED"

I always have fun with the actual filming process. Running around the city like I’m very important, with a tripod, filming myself with a mug of coffee (there was no coffee in the mug actually — and where I actually drink something, I always use cola). Anyway, during the last warm days I managed to shoot this kind of short film with a meaning. I honestly like it myself.
