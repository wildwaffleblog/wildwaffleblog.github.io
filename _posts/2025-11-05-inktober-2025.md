title: "INKTOBER 2025"

Oh yeah! I finally did it! I completed Inktober all the way to the end. Part of my motivation was also knowing that I’d talk about it later in a video. But there’s nothing wrong with one form of creativity pushing another one forward, right?

I also prepared a PDF where I collected all the illustrations from this month and the story I tell through the captions.
