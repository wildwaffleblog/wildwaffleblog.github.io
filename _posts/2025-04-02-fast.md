title: "Fast"

The video “Fast” was, of course, inspired by GAWX’s style. I tried, for the first time, to shoot something more intentional, with voice-over narration and complex, fast-paced editing. It was genuinely fun — fun to shoot, fun to edit, and fun to watch afterward. When I finished this video, I started to wonder: could I keep doing editing this complex all the time? Probably not. As cool as it is, I’m not GAWX. And I need to have my own style.
