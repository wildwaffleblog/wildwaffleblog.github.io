title: "Waterlines"
---

Since late autumn 2024, I've been running a YouTube channel. I started posting something like a monthly video journal, where I would share what happened to me over the month, reflect on it, and set goals. I called these videos "Waterlines" - for me, they were a kind of "water level check," a chance to step back and look at my life from the outside. Honestly, I was scared to start, and I still feel nervous in front of the camera. It's not easy to just open up and talk about something personal. But I tried.

Not every video turned out to be meaningful. I often repeated the same thoughts and didn't always achieve the goals I set for myself. But the process itself allowed me to grow. That's why, in August, I filmed my last Waterline. I'm ready to keep reflecting without these videos, ready to keep growing as a creator, and I've reserved YouTube now for content that feels far more valuable.
